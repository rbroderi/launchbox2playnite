    Description: Some would call it Impossible Pinball.  Not that it is difficult
      to play, rather that you could never build a pinball machine that could do the
      type of things that this game does.  But it seems as though that's the point.  As
      like any pinball game, there is an underlying plot in which you must achieve
      certain goals on each of the three pinball tables (you can warp between them).This
      takes you off into the fantasy pinball world, where anything can happen.  Tanks
      can attack your ball, comets can fly in and create a crater in the middle of
      the board.  Who knows what will happen next.

      the world's navies. Age of Sail is a real time combat game. You control a tall
      ship and engage in cannon battles with enemy fleets. Gameplay centers around
      tactical decisions like selection of ordinance for the cannons, using the wind
      and maneuvering into position to fire at the enemy. In the campaign mode you
      start as an Ensign for one of four countries - Britain, Spain, France or the
      United States - and work your way up through the ranks. There are also about
      one hundred historical scenarios you can play, most of them taking place during
      the Napoleonic wars and the War of 1812. Scenarios give you control of multiple
      ships per battle.

      The settings are Europe, Russia and Northern Africa.The most important thing
      to have are prestige points. These are earned by solving scenarios (more for
      a little amount of turns) and used to buy replacement units. But this is not
      the only reason to be concerned about the detailed mission results: surviving
      units are transferred to the next mission and receive experience points. The
      campaign is also not completely linear, and the next mission depends on the
      result of the last - this means a lost scenario does not necessarily result
      in a game over, and a scarce victory can have devastating results. Of course
      a great victory has positive effects on the next missions.Every turn the player
      plans the actions of his units and tries to defeat his enemy. The complexity
      of the game mostly comes from the many different units and weapons - everything
      has their use and weaknesses. It is vital to use the resources in the correct
      order and combination. There are also other factors to think about, e.g. fuel.
      Allied General tries to be player friendly by giving feedback during turns,
      e.g. by showing the probable combat result before the player issues the attack.
      He can also undo a turn as long as no new enemy units are scouted. Other extras
      are historical film material and optional combat animations.'

    Description: 'ArtRageous! is a series of games and other interactive learning
      activities centered around art history. The learning adventure begins in a virtual
      plaza where the player/student can choose from a number of destinations to visit.
      Among the destinations are sizable, cross-referenced databases of both paintings
      and painter biographies.The main attraction of Artrageous! is the rich variety
      of activities present. The activities cover 5 categories of understanding and
      appreciating art: Color, light, perspective, composition, and the life of art.
      The color category includes a color mixing game in which you must use varying
      amounts of red, blue, and yellow components to build a hue/saturation color
      wheel. Another activity demonstrates the effect of adjusting the brightness
      or contrast of a picture. These and other activities are supplemented with narrated
      explanations of color concepts.The activities covering light include a sphere
      with lights placed around it-- click on one of the lights to understand the
      visual effects of different light sources. Also, a game that explains light
      demonstrates how outlines create shape. The player''s goal is to match a number
      of outlines to their respective images within a mish-mash painting.One of the
      perspective category games is to arrange a roomful of floating objects where
      they would fit more appropriately on the painting backdrop. Both the painting
      and the objects are drawn with a 3D perspective which gives the player clues
      about placement. Further, the player can elect to bring up a vanishing point
      line grid for help.The composition section demonstrates how elements of paintings
      convey meaning. One game that illustrates this concept asks the player to match
      which shape or concept (circle, triangle, balanced scale, or unbalanced scale)
      best represents each of a selection of paintings.The life of art category features
      a jigsaw puzzle game using square pieces. The player must re-assemble the puzzle
      in a given period of time.'

      light, perspective, composition, and the life of art. The color category includes
      a color mixing game in which you must use varying amounts of red, blue, and
      yellow components to build a hue/saturation color wheel. Another activity demonstrates
      the effect of adjusting the brightness or contrast of a picture. These and other
      activities are supplemented with narrated explanations of color concepts.


      The activities covering light include a sphere with lights placed around it
      -- click on one of the lights to understand the visual effects of different
      light sources. Also, a game that explains light demonstrates how outlines create
      shape. The player''s goal is to match a number of outlines to their respective
      images within a mish-mash painting.


      One of the perspective category games is to arrange a roomful of floating objects
      where they would fit more appropriately on the painting backdrop. Both the painting
      and the objects are drawn with a 3D perspective which gives the player clues
      about placement. Further, the player can elect to bring up a vanishing point
      line grid for help.


      The composition section demonstrates how elements of paintings convey meaning.
      One game that illustrates this concept asks the player to match which shape
      or concept (circle, triangle, balanced scale, or unbalanced scale) best represents
      each of a selection of paintings.


      The life of art category features a jigsaw puzzle game using square pieces.
      The player must re-assemble the puzzle in a given period of time.'

    Description: 'Battle Isle 2220: Shadow of the Emperor is a hex-based strategy
      game featuring live-action video sequences and real-time 3D fight animations.


      Set 20 years after the events of Battle Isle 2200 player plays as Caro, the
      leader of the Kais, in a civil conflict against the Drulls, on the planet Chromos.
      The Drulls are led by Ben Haris, the son of Val Haris, the protagonist of the
      previous game in the series. Caro''s aircraft crashes on an island where, in
      tunnels under the island, she comes into contact with the Emperor Punt Vassius,
      a disembodied survivor of a long-dead imperial dynasty, who offers his support
      to her, including the many powerful military units entombed with him, in return
      for restoring the empire and doing his bidding.


      The game is a hex-based wargame. A single-player campaign of 20 missions is
      included. The goal of each mission typically involves the destruction of enemy

    Description: Clue is a full-motion video adaptation of the popular board game
      of the same name. It is an amalgamation of two earlier CD-i titles where (up
      to six) players take turns investigating a mansion where a murder happened,
      uncovering clues and evidence to reveal the assassin. There are three storylines
      with four difficulty levels, each with a unique solution making it altogether
      twelve different mysteries:Deadly PatentMr.Boddy steals a formula to produce
      artificial rubies from Professor Plumm.The Road to DamascusMr.Boddy almost dies
      in a car accident. He is rescued by the monks of the Order of Silence. Upon
      his return, he decides to join the order and give his fortune to it.BlackmailMr.Boddy
      convinces all his acquaintances to invest on Bolders Brewery.The movement system,
      where the player moves the cursor to a portion of the screen and clicks on it
      to move or turn to that direction is similar to the one found in the The 7th
      Guest. Inside the rooms the screen switches to a 360║ panorama that can be scrolled
      by moving the cursor to its edges. Clicking on clocks starts a flashback video
      of what happened on the room before the crime was committed. Clicking on suspects
      brings up the interrogation screen, where they can be inquired about weapons,
      their alibis, etc. Clicking on secret passages transports the player to another
      room. Clicking on the bell calls the butler and the accusation menu, where the
      player chooses the weapon and the murderer. Afterwards, the butler informs if
      the player made the right choice. A notebook keeps track of all the information
      collected, and can be accessed at any time.Each of the four difficulty levels
      have a different number of accusations available (3 on the easiest level, 1
      on the hardest one). In the easier levels the room positions are fixed, while
      in the tougher levels they are random.In each player's turn they can perform
      two moves, two actions or a action and a move. A move is defined by entering
      and leaving a room. A action is defined by examining items, interrogating suspects
      or watching a flashback.

      to use toys, an elevator, how to eat etc. They will eventually grow older, reproduce
      themselves and die. The game uses its own genetics system, as well as biochemical
      and neurological calculations to determine the evolution of Norns and the way
      their DNA would develop in their descendants.

      main difference between Dagger's Rage and another game that might be compared
      to it -- i.e. Privateer -- is that this is less a space sim and actually is
      quite arcade-ish.  You control your ship through a top-down view, and combat
      plays like a toned-down shooter such as Tyrian.  Battles take place on various
      planets and in space.  The terrain, however, is 3D.

    Description: 'Deadlock: Planetary Conquest is a 2D turn-based 4X strategy. Players
      take the roles of aliens deadlocked on a planet surface. The game has seven
      different races with special abilities, for example the Maugs are great scientists,
      ChCh-T have the highest birth rate etc. They spend turns building, expanding,
      and ultimately warring. The planet''s surface is divided into smaller areas.
      Each area is home to one of the cities that need to be constructed. To colonize
      a new area, the player must build a colonizer. Players can expand their cities
      by erecting residential buildings, farms, factories, mines and research centres.
      Inventions made in the latter provide new units, new materials and better buildings
      (for example a hydroponic farm is far better than a normal farm). The residents''
      satisfaction is important - dissatisfied citizens (taxes are too high) protest
      and don''t work.


      The battle begins after the player places their units in a foreign land. Battles
      are separately animated - after being initiated players have no control over
      them. The game also has a spying mechanic that spies can use to steal technologies.
      The player wins by fulfilling one of the victory conditions, for example remaining
      the last living race on the planet, or reaching a set number of city centres
      first.'

    Description: 'Designed as an educational learning tool for three to eight-year-olds,
      this features a rendered 3D world of the Toy Story universe, including all characters
      from the movie and many related sources. There are 15 screens of interactive
      story segments that include text, speech and exploration elements. Scenes are
      interactive in that you''re given the option to select various items to check
      out in each location. In addition to the storybook element, there are five activities
      including the Put-Away Game, Woody''s Scheme, The Crane Game, The Escape Plan
      and a Maze Game. In the Put-Away Game, you must place Andy''s toys in the correct
      locations before his birthday guests arrive. Featuring Woody, there are three
      distinct games including Shadow Shape Matching, Warmer/Colder and Following
      Directions - these involve matching shapes to corresponding shadows, receiving
      clues based on warmer and colder responses and following verbal directions as
      to where the toys go respectively.


      Woody''s Scheme is a devious plan to knock Buzz Lightyear behind a desk using
      a domino effect. There''s only one problem - the toys are out of whack and it''s
      up to you to place them in correct alignment. In The Crane Game, you match up
      Martians of different sizes and shapes and shove them into backpacks. Spanning
      three levels, the number of aliens required changes in each. In an attempt to
      save Buzz Lightyear from the vile clutches of Sid, the Escape Plan is broken
      into three activities: the Doorbell, the Toy Stack and the Stairs. After commanding
      Ducky and Legs to ring a doorbell, you erect a large pillar to reach the door
      handle. Finally, in the Stairs, you help Woody and Babyface maneuver past the
      obstacles on each step. The Maze Game features a bird''s eye view of a city
      with traffic lights and obstacles. Try not to get hung up -- you''re being chased
      by the evil Scud. It also has troubleshooting activities and recommendations
      on expanding the skills learned with the program.'

    Description: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree is the second title in the Disney's
      Animated Storybook series, based on the classic story from A. A. Milne. The
      story follows Pooh, who is out of honey and out looking for more, who eventually
      ends up stuck inside of Rabbit's door. His friends must pull as hard as they
      can to try and get Pooh out. Each page has interactive things to click on, and
      others have mini-games or an interactive song to go along with it. There are
      four mini-games in total, all of which are very simple for the age market. In
      the first mini-game, you must listen to Piglet and find the right toy according
      to his description. The next mini-game is a puzzle where you must find honey
      on Rabbit's shelves in order to satisfy Pooh. In the third mini-game, you must
      clean up Rabbit's shelves after Pooh got himself stuck and wrecked all the objects
      in his house. The final mini-game stars Roo, where you must catch butterflies.
      Each mini-game is very easy and has no difficulty level to change, which is
      understandable considering the age demographic is 3-6. There is no end goal
      to the game, it is just a simple storybook with a few minigames placed here
      and there to keep young children interested.

    Description: 'Toy Story Activity Center is an educational and entertaining title,
      not to be confused with the other Toy Story title, the Animated Storybook.


      The hybrid CD-ROM features many classic mini-games such as Five-In-A-Row, or
      a memory challenging game a la Simon Says, with 4 green aliens popping up out
      of boxes or a math card game with an Etch-A-Sketch.


      Other mini-games include a Code Breaker, and, in order stimulate creativity,
      a music activity aka Sid''s Sonic Boom Box and a build-your-own-monster activity.
      The icon-driven interface, at the lower-right corner of each screen is quite
      simple. e.g. numbers 1 to 3 let kids choose from one of the three levels of
      difficulty, and the printer icon is self-explanatory. Needless to say, many
      video clips from the film are available.'

    Description: 'Toy Story Activity Center is an educational and entertaining title,
      not to be confused with the other Toy Story title, the Animated Storybook.


      The hybrid CD-ROM features many classic mini-games such as Five-In-A-Row, or
      a memory challenging game a la Simon Says, with 4 green aliens popping up out
      of boxes or a math card game with an Etch-A-Sketch.


      Other mini-games include a Code Breaker, and, in order stimulate creativity,
      a music activity aka Sid''s Sonic Boom Box and a build-your-own-monster activity.
      The icon-driven interface, at the lower-right corner of each screen is quite
      simple. e.g. numbers 1 to 3 let kids choose from one of the three levels of
      difficulty, and the printer icon is self-explanatory. Needless to say, many
      video clips from the film are available.'

    Description: 'Duck City is a wacky and fun collection of 6 action and puzzle games
      designed for kids of all ages. Designed by Alan Snow, creator of P.A.W.S, Duck
      City stars a talking cartoon duck who wanders around in his cartoon world, getting
      into one trouble after another. In one mini-game that is similar to basketball,
      you will see how a duck can pull off spectacular slam dunks. In the farm, you
      must fatten slugs by feeding them cabbages. The barber shop is the site of one
      of the game''s most unique games: here, you cut and dry customers'' hair to
      make cool haircuts. In the garage, you can participate in a fun cross-country
      racing. And finally in a lab, you can tinker with various gadgets and interact
      with RoboDuck, a cross between RoboCop and a duck. All the games are simple
      to learn and easy to use - you need to memorize only a few keys and mouse clicks.
      With attractive and creative cartoon graphics, fun mini-games, and a transparent
      and intuitive interface, Duck City is a fun "interactive environment" for everyone
      in the family. None of the game has lasting play value, but they are ideal for
      a 5-10 minute coffee break at the office... or a fun evening for the kids in
      your house.'

    Description: In Maze Madness, Freddi's friend Luther has managed to accidentally
      scatter Grandma Grouper's kelp seeds throughout a gigantic set of underwater
      mazes.  You control Freddi Fish, who sets out to find and recover all of the
      missing kelp seeds.   As she advances through 50 levels (plus bonus rounds),
      you'll need to solve simple puzzles, avoid pesky critters, and pick up special
      items which will help her on her way.  After all of the kelp seeds have been
      picked up in a maze, Freddi will automatically advance to the next round.The
      player controls Freddi by using the mouse or keyboard. The cursor keys move
      Freddi, while the Enter and Ctrl keys allow Freddi to fire when she has the
      Bubble-Shooter power-up.  If you choose to use the mouse, simply move the cursor
      arrow to a target location for Freddi, click the left mouse button, and she'll
      attempt to swim toward the target - Freddi will be able to navigate corners,
      but only one at a time, so if she's unable to swim to the target, try breaking
      the trip up into shorter pieces.   If Freddi has the Bubble-Shooter powerup,
      she'll fire bubbles if she is directly facing the target, and if the mouse button
      is held down briefly. The game allows multiple people to play the game with
      their progress recorded under their own name. The game allows you to save or
      exit the game after each level is finished, and previously finished levels can
      be re-played.The game also comes with a level editor, that is icon-based rather
      than text-based so non-readers can use it.

    Description: In Water Worries, you play Luther, a young green fish who gets sucked
      into a whirlpool and must find his way out.  Luther's search will eventually
      take him through 100 underwater levels jam-packed full of action and adventure.  On
      the way home, Luther will need to be aware of the hazards around him, while
      picking up worm doodles which will allow him to advance further.  Bubbles, which
      are constantly rising from deep within the whirlpool, will force the water level
      down if they are allowed to reach the water's surface.  If the water level becomes
      too low, Luther will have to retry the level, minus one energy level.  To prevent
      this from happening, Luther must use his trusty slingshot and unlimited supply
      of ammo to pop the bubbles before they reach the surface.  Luther also needs
      to be careful when navigating the whirlpool, since running into a bubble may
      render him momentarily trapped and unable to fire his slingshot.

      of fruits per row.Once you have started a game, you will be presented with your
      current falling row, which consists of three random fruits. Now it''s your job
      to manipulate the order of the row, how the fruits are falling. Your final goal
      is to form up a row of the same type of fruits on the bottom of the game field,
      once you done this, these fruits will disappear, and the fruits that maybe on
      top of these, will fall further down.How many similar fruits you need for this
      depends on the option you have set before you started. On default it''s three
      fruits, maximal is eight fruits (from eight possible squares). You do not need
      to arrange them horizontal, you can also arrange them vertical or diagonal.
      Once this row vanishes, you get your points. If you reach a certain amount of
      points, you proceed to the next level, were this all gets faster. All in all,
      there are 9 levels in total.The fruits you play with are the following: Cherry,
      Strawberry, Watermelon, Apple, Grapefruit, and Plum. In addition, there are
      some kind of red "stars", these are falling only in a row without fruits, once
      they hit the fruits, some of them gets destroyed and you earn points.And in
      addition to the fruit-based-column-game, there is a plain square-based-column-game
      included, which can be activated (or deactivated) from the options.'

    Description: 'Gabriel Knight is a wise-cracking bookstore owner and would-be author.
      He is the last in a long line of Shadow Hunters, those fated to fight supernatural
      forces of evil. Tormented by terrifying nightmares, he must spend every waking
      moment scouring the side streets and back alleys of New Orleans for the key
      to his dark past. One day, a blood-chilling murder shocks the inhabitants of
      the city. The police detective assigned to investigate the crime is Gabriel''s
      friend. In the beginning Gabriel collects evidence in hope of using the material
      for his new novel; but soon he finds himself personally involved in the investigation,
      and plunges deeper into the world of secret societies and murderous cults.Gabriel
      Knight: Sins of the Fathers is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game.
      Created by Jane Jensen, the game differs from Sierra''s Quest games (e.g. Space
      Quest) by having a realistic setting and focusing (despite its supernatural
      elements and humor) on mature themes and detective work. In this way it is more
      similar to the company''s earlier Laura Bow games. The game''s icon-based interface
      is the same as in Sierra''s previous titles, with verb commands that allow interaction
      with the game world and its inhabitants. Though the game still has plenty of
      inventory-based puzzles characteristic for classic adventure, its gameplay is
      heavily inclined towards dialogue. Typically, Gabriel will have to interrogate
      other characters, choosing conversation topics and thus gradually finding clues
      and advancing towards the mystery''s solution.The game''s locations are done
      in hand-painted style. The CD version of the game adds full voice-overs to the
      dialogues, as well as narrator''s voice to text descriptions.'

    Description: Charles Schultz's famous and lovable comic strip characters come
      to life as the Peanuts gang teams up to help children learn vocabulary, spelling,
      and reading through a variety of letter -- and word-related activities. By spending
      a day in the life of Charlie Brown, children can learn new words, practice spelling,
      create sentences and stories, read comics, and play games with the Peanuts kids.
      An intuitive user interface, coupled with top-notch music and animation, makes
      it fun to use. Its activities, like Hangman and the Spelling Bee, may seem like
      old standbys, but the title presents them with an entertaining, Peanuts-style
      twist. More important, they are challenging and effective at improving spelling
      and vocabulary. While no one will view the integrated dictionary as a substitute
      for a full-featured multimedia dictionary, its entries are all first vocabulary
      words and the program fosters its use. The game is recommended for ages 4 to
      8. It has 3 levels of difficulty, and there's integrated into the program an
      illustrated, 1,000-word dictionary.

    Description: Take control of one of the existing Formula 1 teams (or one of two
      customizable fictitious ones) and try to take them to the top of the start in
      this management simulation.Every major decision is under your control. You must
      choose which parts of the car to improve, including Driver Aids whose legality
      varies over the years - is the extra performance worth the risk of disqualifications?
      Testing will help you assess the car's performance and prepare set-ups for the
      next race.Staff can be hired and fired, ranging form drivers to designers and
      commercial staff, which often means trading off having a large team, or a small
      but well-drilled and capable one. Obtaining and retaining the interest of sponsors
      and engine manufacturers is a crucial challenge as the years go on.Once the
      race weekend comes around, you must make the best use of practice and qualifying
      sessions, as well as preparing a pit strategy and being ready to adjust it if
      incidents, weather or unexpected performance issues occur. The action is viewed
      from overhead, with full commentary.There are also 5 Challenges, which set you
      a specific task based on one changed variable (such as bank balance, driver
      skill and engine supply).

    Description: Green Thumb Cards is a virtual version of an actual card game.  Four
      players (up to 3 of which can be played by the computer) take cards featuring
      flowers, garden pests, helpful tools and random acts of nature.  Players try
      to obtain complete sets of flowers by taking cards from the stack, stealing
      cards from another player, or picking up cards out of the center walkways.  For
      example, it takes 4 roses to complete the rose set.  Once a player has successfully
      planted all cards of a set in their garden, they have earned the points for
      that set and can no longer lose those cards.  Other players can steal cards
      by using a pest card.  Pests can be defended against by using the appropriate
      defense card.  The player who has earned the most points when all cards have
      been used is the winner.  Game featured net play as well as offline play.

    Description: Johnny Mnemonic is based on William Gibson's short story and a subsequent
      movie of the same name. The game's plot bears more similarities to the movie
      than to the original story. Johnny is a courier in a futuristic society, delivering
      data implanted in his brain. However, the latest delivery is so big that it
      can kill him if he doesn't download the data. Unfortunately, the only person
      who knew the password is dead, and members of the Yakuza are hunting for the
      data and for its living container.The game consists of live-action video footage
      and interactive sequences, some of which play like adventure game segments and
      may contain simple puzzles, while others are more action-oriented. Johnny's
      bodyguard Jane often handles the fighting episodes; the player can assign buttons
      to punches and kicks. The adventure parts contain limited exploration and interaction
      with the environment, and mostly serve to advance the plot.

    Description: 'Hopsalot, the Jump Start bunny, is showing off his Great Grandrabbit''s
      gramophone, when he is suddenly pulled right into the gramophone''s trumpet
      and into the Land of Music, hot on the trail of a batch of sour notes. It appears
      that the evil Sir Sournote has soured all the music; Hopsalot must travel throughout
      the Land of Music collecting all the ruined notes in his bag, and bring them
      to the Concert Hall to sweeten them again.The interface is point and click on
      the map screen (simply moving the mouse on the screen will cause Hopsalot to
      follow; click to enter a game) and in the mini-games, with the addition of certain
      keyboard keys: spacebar in the rhythm games, left and right sides of the keyboard
      and the enter key in the Jam With Cool Cat game.As you move Hopsalot around
      the Land of Music map, you''ll find these activities:   Music Monkey û view
      a short piece of music and listen to it, then find the notes that Sir Sournote
      has replaced with sour ones  Gorilla, Goat and Hippo û Listen to a character
      play a rhythm and then play it back using the spacebar  Young Girl û Listen
      to Melody play sounds, then repeat them; play your own music on the bridge and
      hear it played back   Musical Instruments û these instruments have lost their
      voices; choose the bird that sounds like each instrument to replace it  Cool
      Cat û Jam with Cool Cat in free play using the keyboard, then play it back by
      clicking the gramophone  After successfully playing an activity, Hopsalot  is
      given the opportunity to collect some sour notes in his bag û the cursor becomes
      a grasping hand and you must catch the notes as they dart around the screen
      in a mini arcade game. On each map screen, although the activities remain basically
      the same the difficulty level is increased, for example, instead of finding
      the voice for one instrument you will have two; the number of beats you have
      to follow in a rhythm game will increase, as will the number of sour notes to
      find in a piece of music. Once you have collected all the sour notes in an area
      it glows red on the map, so you know how much you''ve done. In addition, clicking
      on the music note on the bottom right of the screen brings up the options, where
      you can click on Hopsalot''s bag to see how many sour notes have been collected.When
      all the sour notes are collected and brought to the Concert Hall to be sweetened,
      Hopsalot presents you with a Sweet Note award that can be printed.'

    Description: 'JumpStart Kindergarten Reading is an educational title aimed at
      four to seven year olds.


      The game features a Rabbit called Hopsalot. He''s on holiday from school and
      wants to find the treasure buried in his carrot patch. He has six relatives
      each of which has a clue so, with the help of the pupil, off he goes. Each visit
      is in two parts, for example visiting Granny in the frozen north starts with
      a request to click on all the items beginning with a specific letter to defrost
      them. There''s usually around half a dozen items on the ground of which four
      match the specified criteria. Once this task has been completed the pupil goes
      to an ice hockey practice session. Here a letter is shown on the scoreboard
      and hockey pucks with three and four letter words are slid over the ice. If
      the initial letter of the word matches the target letter the pupil clicks on
      the puck and, if they''re right, it''s fired into the net. If the initial letter
      does not match the target letter they click on the referee and the puck melts
      away. After completing the mini games the player is shown a clue to the carrot
      patch treasure, this specifies a letter. The player is then taken to the carrot
      patch where they must identify the letter from those shown, they click on it,
      a tunnel is dug to that spot where there will be an object and a small animation.


      Different games stress different reading elements. Alfie the Jazz Hamster asks
      the pupil to choose words that rhyme, Grandad gets the pupil to match upper
      and lower case letters, Flash asks the pupil to spell/complete words that come
      from a volcano while Robbie at the ranch expects pupils to decide whether a
      word is real of not.


      The game makes extensive use of music and small animations as rewards and as
      ways to keep the pupil interested. The game supports multiple players, just
      one at a time though, and while each player will perform the same tasks there
      will probably be a difference, for example visiting Granny at the North Pole
      as three separate players each had to select items from the ground to defrost
      but they were different objects each time. As the players progress they will
      replay the same activities but at a harder level.'

      old, the player is taken to  the colorful main page: a town map full of clickable
      icons leading to activities and song. Each activity begins at the easiest level,
      and can be adjusted manually, or the game will automatically adjust as the player
      responds with correct answers. All actions are point and click and there are
      many clickable places on the map and in each area that produce animations. As
      the player progresses through an area, correct answers will earn him stars,
      and four stars give him a chance to pick an object (trees, playground equipment,
      characters) to place in the town park named for him. The areas to explore are:   Carousel
      - Clicking the number on the carousel that matches the number of balloons the
      mouse holds lets the mouse climb aboard  Bakery - the player follows verbal
      and pictured instruction to connect frosting dots on a cake  Airport - using
      onscreen arrows or the arrow keys, the player moves a plane up and down on a
      scrolling screen, flying through clouds with shapes that do not match a pictured
      shape. In free play mode, clicking the paint bucket allows the player to decorate
      the skies with color or patterns  Fire Station - a memory game; the player turns
      over objects around the station to reveal pictures and make a match  Diner -
      Kisha sets out food in an ordered row (dark to light, full to empty) and then
      mixes it up; the player must put it back into the same order  Barbershop - a
      musical matching game with similarities to Simon; the player matches a sequence
      of shapes which in turn cause the barbershop septet to sound off a short tune  Clothing
      Store - the player must put together a letter jigsaw to be "ironed" onto a t-shirt;
      the T-shirts can then be printed as coloring pages  Toy Shop - the player builds
      the toy shown on the right by choosing parts from the shelves; one click attaches
      the part, and wrong parts must be clicked again to remove before the toy reaches
      the end of the conveyor belt  Construction Site - the player loads up a truck
      before it enters a tunnel by clicking on objects that match a given one  Park
      - As the player wins stars for correct answers in the activities, four stars

      of the screen is a blue notebook icon where parents can access a progress report
      showing the percentages of correct and attempted answers for each skill covered.
      The focus of this game is on decision-making and problem-solving as well as
      beginning to learn letters, shapes, colors and numbers. In addition to the game
      content, the songs on the disc can be played in any audio CD player, beginning
      from track 2.'

    Description: 'Queen Valanice of Daventry has always thought that getting married
      would be the best course of action for her daughter Rosella. However, the young
      princess seems to be more interested in adventure, recklessly following a mysterious
      magical creature into a whirlpool that eventually transfer herself and her mother
      to another world. The two end up in different parts of a land known as Eldritch,
      with Rosella being transformed into a troll. They must find each other and eventually
      defeat an evil sorceress who plots to ruin the land.


      Like its predecessors, King''s Quest VII is an adventure game primarily based
      on solving inventory puzzles. It discards the icon-based interface of the two
      previous installments, and instead features a simplified "smart cursor" used
      for general interaction with highlighted objects and characters, as well as
      significantly fewer text descriptions. The game is divided into chapters, alternating
      between the queen and the princess as protagonists. As opposed to the realistic
      drawing style of all the preceding game, it has brightly colored visuals reminiscent
      of Walt Disney cartoons.'

    Description: 'Love for Sail! is the sixth game in Al Lowe''s Leisure Suit Larry
      series. Larry unexpectedly receives a ticket to a cruise ship. Upon the arrival
      of the passengers, a mega-contest is announced. This contest includes various
      kinds of sports and activities, from bowling to love-making. The winner will
      get to "score" with the sexy Captain Thigh. Naturally, there is no way Larry
      can win this contest fairly, so he must use his brains to solve the tricky puzzles
      of the game, and cheat his way into the Captain''s bed.The game''s structure
      is similar to that of its predecessor: the entire game takes place in a large
      enclosed area (in this case, the cruise ship), with the gameplay focusing on
      inventory-based puzzles and conversations. The game features a context-sensitive
      interface: clicking on an object brings forth a series of verbs which the player
      can choose in order to interact with the given object. In addition to that,
      it is possible to try and type any other verb (provided the game understands
      it), just like in old adventure games with text interface. Sometimes it is necessary
      to think outside of the box and come up with unusual actions in order to solve
      a puzzle.Several new features have been added to the game, attempting to make
      players into more "active" participants of the playing process. Using a microphone,
      players can add their own voices, while using a scanner lets players insert
      their own photos into the game. Another feature that grabs attention is the
      automatic wallpaper. When Larry "scores" with a woman, that woman''s image can
      be displayed as wallpaper on the Windows desktop.'

      question out loud and also provide hints. There are 3 difficulty levels for
      this game. In Eggs Away, you have to catch the eggs that the chickens lay before
      they hit the ground - catch enough and you move onto the next level, but you
      have to watch out for the rats. There''s also the Find It game, where the game
      randomly picks 10 items (out of 110 possible) within the game and you go find
      them around the farm. This game has 3 difficulty levels. Finally, there''s Spell
      It. This spelling game has three difficulty levels - at the easiest level you
      just add a single missing letter to a word (there''s a picture of the farm-related
      item); at the medium level you have to figure out the word based on a picture;
      at the hardest level there''s no picture. The on-screen cows indicate your progress

    Description: 'In 1893, an English archaeologist called Sir Evangel finds a strange
      stone in a London antiquary. The galopetra ("milk stone") has a hieroglyphic
      and a maze carved on one side, and a Minotaur on the reverse. Intrigued, he
      travels to Crete and starts to explore the newly discovered Knossos ruins. Searching
      the labyrinth, he stumbles upon a time machine, dubbing it the "Loony Machine".
      He leaves instructions at the site on how the device works, for future explorers
      willing to travel to 2000 years in the past and assume the role of Theseus,
      the slayer of the Minotaur.


      Loony Labyrinth is the 4th pinball simulator created by LittleWing. It has one
      table with classic proto-Greek mythological themes. As an explorer and later
      as the legendary hero Theseus, the objective is to first find and activate the
      time machine, and then go back to ancient times and defeat the Minotaur.


      In the first part, the goal is to collect all the five galopetra stones and
      install them to activate the machine. The ball has to hit drop targets near
      the stone ramp to make one of the STONE light letters start flashing. One stone
      is collected by sending the ball up the ramp while the light is blinking. Getting
      all the stones awards five million points. To install them, the ball has to
      hit several times the energy charger bumper, raising the energy level to 100%
      and turning on the install hole.


      After traveling to 2000 B.C., the music changes and a multiball starts to indicate
      the switch. The goal is to rescue nine human sacrifices and kill the Minotaur.
      The LOONY LABYRINTH lights at the center of the table turn on to show the number
      of hostages, turning off with every saved victim. Shooting the labyrinth ramp
      rescues them one at time. After everyone is safe, a multiball starts where the
      player must sink three balls in the Minotaur chamber before the moon phase indicators
      near the flippers turn off, to defeat the creature and win the game.'

    Description: Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show is an educational game for
      children aged five and up. It is based on the 1999 Madeline book by Ludwig Bemelmans,
      which also spawned a media franchise and a US TV series. The game was released
      to coincide with the premiere of the animated TV series The New Adventures of
      Madeline. Madeline's neighbor, who takes care of animals, is about to lose her
      home, but staging a puppet show could bring in the money needed so he can pay
      the rent to keep living there with his animals. Madeline and various kids journey
      through Paris in the neighborhood of her boarding school with different learning
      activities presented as mini-games and collecting items such as curtains, a
      cape, a chain, bread, gumballs, a balloon and puppets for the show along the
      way.

      of questions based on specialized field of your choice, while in the second
      round you must answer a set of general knowledge questions. Both rounds have
      a time limit of 2 minutes. Any question may be passed (skipped), so that you
      may answer more questions in the allotted time.The person who gets the most
      questions right wins the contest. If a tie occurs, the person with the most
      passes is the loser in the contest. If a tie occurs between two players with
      an equal number of passes, the contestants must answer a set of five questions
      - all five questions being the same between contestants - as a tie breaker.The
      host of the Mastermind game is (the now-late) Magnus Magnusson, who also hosted
      the real life Mastermind program for its entire first run from 1972 to 1997.
      If you run out of time in a round while he is posing a question to you, he'll
      state MastermindsÆ "I've started so I'll finish," catchphrase that he coined
      during the course of the program, finishing up the question and allowing you
      to answer it.Mastermind sports over 5,000 questions to answer, and has 50 groups
      of specialized questions.

      at the beginning of the game. The Galactic Commander gives Math Blaster the
      mission to follow the Trash Alien to his home planet and rescue Spot.


      The game starts with a complete mission (story mode). The mission consists of
      a series of four (three in the console versions) math activities (mini-games)
      strung together with cut-scenes. The activities can also be played separately,
      for practice or for score.


      The activities are as follows:


      Trash Zapper - Solve equations to gain tractor beam power, then use the tractor
      beam to collect space trash.

      Number Recycler (PC version only) - Create equations by pushing around columns
      of numbers and operators. Correct equations allow you to turn the trash you
      collected into fuel.

      Cave Runner - Use Math Blaster''s jet pack to fly through a cave. He has a number
      on his chest, and it must be arithmetically between the numbers on each side
      of an opening in order for him to pass through. Droplets of water falling from
      above can change this number by performing an operation on it. There are also
      gems which can be collected for bonus points, and in higher levels, monsters
      appear that can knock Math Blaster down.

      Math Blaster - The Trash Alien''s spaceship displays an equation, and the four
      portholes serve as multiple-choice answers. Use the jet pack to fly into the
      correct portholes while avoiding floating trash and energy blasts from the ship.
      Bonus gems also appear at random, and after five problems a bonus round occurs
      where players get a chance to collect as many gems as they can within a time
      limit.

      Upon finishing the complete mission, the player is presented with a certificate
      that can be printed out (PC version only). Their final score is also added to
      a high score board for their account.'

      Idol, which has recently vanished.  Early on, Maui can also switch between his
      normal self and Ninja Maui, and with all the creepy voodoo enemies he'll encounter
      throughout his adventure, he's going to need all the help he can get.As previously
      mentioned, there are two personalities to Maui, and as a result, two different
      sets of controls.  Normal Maui carries a bug gun, which can fire a variety of
      different insect ammo, from basic bugs, to the more powerful lightning and fire
      bugs.  It's also possible for Maui to combine bugs to pack a more powerful blast
      at his enemies.Once Maui starts to find Yin-Yang coins, he'll be able to transform
      into Ninja Maui.  Ninja Maui has lightning-quick reflexes, and wields a bo staff.  In
      addition to being handy for whacking enemies, Ninja Maui can also climb between
      walls by jumping and propping the staff between the walls at the height of his
      jump.  He can also hook onto duck heads and swing from them to reach areas he
      normally couldn't.  You'll need to constantly find Yin-Yang coins to fuel your
      Ninja persona, otherwise you'll run out and transform back to Maui Mallard.The
      level layout in the Game Boy version is slightly different with less secrets
      to be found.

    Description: 'Microsoft Golf 2.0 is the second and last of the Win 3.1 Microsoft
      Golf games. As its predecessor, it is simply Links 386 Pro, but with added graphical
      detail that comes much closer to its original DOS version.


      The main layout of the screen is changed but otherwise the game remains the
      same. Select Quick Start to use the default settings or settings from a previous
      game. There is a Practice Mode and an in-game Help System that teaches you about
      the game of golf in general as well as how this game is played.


      Microsoft Golf 2.0 comes with two courses: Torrey Pines and Firestone South.
      The game also offers compatibility with the Links 386 Pro courses (available
      separately).


      Microsoft''s "PlayerNet" is used as the avenue for multiplayer golf. Each person
      must have PlayerNet and the game installed on their system to play.'

    Description: 'Millie''s Math House is the first game in Edmark''s early line-up
      of educational games designed for very young children to use. The interface
      is completely point-and-click, with little to no text and instructions are given
      verbally.The player is taken directly to the main page where Millie perches
      on a desk in front of a row of cubicles, each of which takes the player to a
      math or pre-math activity.There are seven different activities in this game,
      and each activity has two modes; Explore and Discover and Question and Answer.
      The first mode encourages the player to click around and experiment, emphasizing
      that he is in charge. In Question and Answer mode, which is entered by clicking
      the animal inside the picture frame, a character will ask the player to perform
      tasks related to the current area. The following descriptions apply to Question
      and Answer Mode only:  Little, Middle, & Big -  the player is presented with
      three characters and an array of variously-sized shoes; each character will
      ask him to find a pair that fits their particular size.  Mouse House - after
      the player selects a simple or complex blueprint for a house, Frank Lloyd Mouse
      will ask him to find all the shapes to build it, one by one.  What''s My Number?
      - standing concealed behind a curtain, Dorothy Duck tells the player how many
      objects she has; the player must select the same number and place them on the
      stage.  Bing & Boing - bouncy creature Boing creates a picture pattern and repeats
      it with something missing; the player is asked to finish it. Each picture also
      has its own associated sound, and if the player has a microphone he can replace
      the sounds with his own.  Build-A-Bug - the rabbit shows the player a plan for
      the number of body parts the bug should have (3 eyes, 8 legs, for example);
      the player must click the correct number from the top of the screen and the
      body part from the left.  Number Machine -  Annie the worm will ask the player
      to find a specific number on the cash register. Choosing the icons on the bottom
      right will raise the numbers on the keys up to 30.  Cookie Factory - Harley
      the horse wants a specific number of jellybeans on his cookie; the player must
      press the dispenser the correct number of timesThe game allows any number of
      tries in Question and Answer mode, the player is not penalized for wrong answers
      at any time. Parents are given several configuration options (Ctrl/Alt + A in
      Windows, Option/Command + A on a Mac), allowing them to disable music, printing,
      set the volume, allow exiting, or enable single switch input, which moves the
      arrow from choice to choice on screen with a click to indicate a selection.The

    Description: On a world far away, many millennia ago, a race of advanced beings
      discovered the 'keys to the universe'. This enabled them to transcend space
      and time, and so they embarked on a journey to the far ends of the Cosmos. Before
      leaving their home world, they created the most advanced artificial intelligence
      ever devised to act as guardian and caretaker. This artificial intelligence
      was named MILO. But MILO was not a perfect creation, his systems required constant
      intellectual stimulation in order to maintain their incredible abilities. Without
      his creators nearby MILO became tired and depleted. As the millennia passed
      Milo's systems began to fail. Milo desperately needed stimulation in order to
      reverse his decline û he needs an encounter with YOU. MILO already knew about
      your arrival, long before you did, so he didn't waste any time and made preparations.
      A series of challenges and puzzles for you, which will recharge his intelligence
      circuits and reverse his decline. The challenges are spread around the home
      world of the creators and special transport has been provided. If you prove
      worthy of the challenge you will gain access to the library where you will come
      face to face with MILO, and if you finally succeed you will be presented with
      the treasured keys to the universe. But if you fail - you will be trapped forever.You
      are free to travel to every part of the planet and all you need is to do is
      solve the puzzles, which are very similar to the ones from  The 7th Guest.

    Description: 'Mind Grind is a one or two player quiz game.


      The player selects a character from one of several that are supplied, most are
      aliens, and competes over five rounds:* The Matrix of Knowledge: This takes
      place on an 8x8 grid and to advance to the next level the player must connecting
      four cells in any direction: horizontally, vertically or diagonally by correctly
      answering the question that they contain.


      * The Pillars of Wisdom: Here the player must advance to the topmost level of
      pillars and they may jump one or two ranks at a time. The difficulty of the
      question is determined by the level of the jump attempted.


      * The Maze of the Mind: Is a randomly generated labyrinth containing forty-five
      45 locked doors. The player must navigate their way out of the maze by answering
      questions to open these doors. Question difficulty will increase as competitors
      progress further into the maze


      * Platforms of Insight: The player(s) stand in a tube. Beneath them are stacked
      platforms containing question topics. Answering a question correctly removes
      a platform while answering one incorrectly adds a platform. Too many wrong answers
      will see the player crushed against the top of the tube.


      * Looking For Signs Of intelligent Life: This is the final level and it sees
      the player piloting a space ship towards earth. To reach their destination the
      player must dock with ten space stations and answer the questions they ask correctly.
      Getting a question wrong means being flung into hyperspace.



      In both one and two player games there are bonus points for being the first
      to complete a stage and options to spend some points/dollars, for example in
      the final level there are meteors and such to be avoided along the way so spending
      points to buy a deflector shield may be a worthwhile investment'

      a board filled with mines, without knowing what fields they occupy. When the
      player clicks on a field a number appears on it, indicating how many mines are
      located in the fields nearest to it. The player then clicks on other fields,

      and the game is over. The game features three difficulty levels, distinguished
      by the size of the board - the bigger the board, the higher the difficulty level.

    Description: 'Mr. Potato Head Saves Veggie Valley is a short educational adventure
      game with point-and-click controls. Veggie Valley has been beset by a terrible
      drought lately. Even more bad luck arrives as ominous clouds threaten the Country
      Fair. Mr. Potato Head and his daughter, Sweet Potato, decide to take matters
      into their own hands, save the fair and bring the clouds to Veggie Valley instead.
      The player controls both of them as they make their way across the valley, solve
      puzzles and visit the fair''s many attractions.The game is intended for pre-school
      kids (less than 7 years) and has relatively simple puzzles. They consist mostly
      of gathering items in the inventory and using them on other objects from the
      world. Disguising the two potatoes represents an important element as well.
      Using the in-game editor, you can replace the eyes, nose, ears, shoes, mouth,
      add a clown wig, and so on. There are several mini games at the local fair,
      three of which (called Midway Games) can be accessed directly from the main
      menu: Funny Photo Booth, Counting Pinball and Match & Catch Fishing. The first
      is another disguise editor, Counting Pinball is a pinball game that teaches
      the player to count, while Match & Catch Fishing''s main goal is to place pairs
      of identical fishes in the top jars. Both the mini games and the full adventure
      have two levels of difficulty.Similarly to other educational games of the era,
      the player can interact with many things from the world, not necessarily pertaining
      to puzzles or story advancement. This can trigger animations or speeches, giving
      a better idea on what the object actually is. The protagonists'' and other characters''

      While the Looks contest seems to be a sorry excuse to stare at pics of scantily
      clad women (there’s no nudity in Ms. Metaverse), it also serves to identify
      males and / or cyborgs which might have slipped into the contest. The Brains
      and Talent contests display coarse videos of the contestants dancing or performing
      awkward sketches with Ms. Metaverse host Monty Megabyte (Chris Bonno). Watching
      these performances costs money, which you earn by shooting girls (see above)
      or playing a simple slot machine. After you’ve reviewed all the ladies, you
      may crown one Ms. Metaverse.

    Description: 'You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled
      Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading
      through its pages provides you with only a description of an island world. But
      it''s just a book, isn''t it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your
      hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with
      the island world the pages described. Now you''re here, wherever here is, with
      no option but to explore.


      Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a
      character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described
      in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game
      is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment
      by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible
      to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set
      in different ages accessed through different books.


      The game''s interface is reduced to a single cursor for navigation and interaction.
      Rather than collecting items and using them to solve puzzles, the player must
      gather subtly placed clues and manipulate complex mechanical devices in order
      to advance in the game. The world of Myst is mostly uninhabited, and the game
      has very few live-action scenes with characters and dialogue.'

    Description: "You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled\
      \ Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is.\
      \ Reading through its pages provides you with only a description of an island\
      \ world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you\
      \ lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness,\
      \ replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever\
      \ here is, with no option but to explore.\n\nMyst is a first-person point-and-click\
      \ adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically\
      \ transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst\
      \ Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static\
      \ scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating\
      \ objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst\
      \ Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages\
      \ accessed through different books. \n\nThe game's interface is reduced to a\
      \ single cursor for navigation and interaction. Rather than collecting items\
      \ and using them to solve puzzles, the player must gather subtly placed clues\
      \ and manipulate complex mechanical devices in order to advance in the game.\
      \ The world of Myst is mostly uninhabited, and the game has very few live-action\
      \ scenes with characters and dialogue."

    Description: Noisy Video Poker and Blackjack for Windows is similar to the video
      machines found in casinos. Originally, Noisy Video Poker and Noisy Video Blackjack
      could be purchased separately or together. If bought together (on one disk),
      both games are accessible within all of the games by clicking your mouse on
      a bottom icon.It is called ôNoisyö for a reason. If you have a sound card, you
      will be treated to a variety of sounds during the game which will bring a smile
      to your face even when you lose.  When you win, you will hear coins dropping
      a metal coin tray.  When you lose, other sounds are played randomly.  There
      are explosion sounds, a car crash, a donkey, and other sounds, which can be
      turned off if you prefer.Betting is done with virtual imaginary coins, and the
      best pay-off (when you win, of course) can be had by betting the maximum of
      5 coins. The game keeps track of your statistics and a complete manual can be
      accessed from the game menu.In Noisy Video Poker, choose from Jacks or Better,
      Joker Wild and Deuces Wild. The objective is to hold the best five card hand
      possible. A pair of jacks or better will return the amount of your bet.  Two
      pair, three of a kind, a straight, a flush, a full house, four of a kind, a
      straight flush, and a royal flush return increasingly greater pay-offs.  If
      you have no pairs or a pair of cards of lower value than jacks, you lose your
      bet.

      wagon. The game also allows the player to create virtual companions for the
      journey, designating their number, names, and ages. As opposed to one year in
      the first game, the sequel allows the player to choose between twenty years
      of travel, from 1840 to 1860.The player is able to choose an occupation for
      the protagonist, such as banker, doctor, gunsmith, carpenter, journalist, butcher,
      pastor, artist, and many others. Different occupations bestow various bonuses
      to the protagonist, and are equipped with passive skills, which will influence
      the rate of success during certain random events and activities. For example,
      a high medical skill will make it more likely that the protagonist recovers
      from a disease; sharpshooting skill contributes to the instant-kill rate when
      hunting animals, etc.The game retains the supply-managing, trading, sailing,
      and most other elements of its predecessor. There are more interactive events
      in the sequel, as the protagonist is able to consult other characters and react
      differently to some of the events that might occur during the journey.

    Description: 'Playskool Puzzles is a set of five educational puzzles intended
      for kids aged 3 to 6:Explore It! - The player chooses between four pictures
      (Park, House, Beach and Farm). Each location will have different elements and
      objects removed and placed randomly at the bottom of the screen. The main objective
      is to reassemble the picture by sticking the objects in their corresponding
      areas. Once the image is back to its original form, the player can click on
      some of its elements to explore them. For example, after completing the park,
      clicking on the circus within it will trigger a new such puzzle. Clicking on
      a particular object in the final exploration puzzle will reveal a separate animation
      featuring it and its name. This way, the kids can learn new words and associate
      them.Puzzle Maker - A puzzle editor. Using the toolbox and a selection of premade
      objects, the user can create new puzzles or modify existing ones. Puzzle Maker
      will automatically import the last picture seen while playing any of the other
      puzzles. The picture can be cut in three different ways and after that you need
      to reassemble it as it''s normally done in Jigsaw.Connect the Dots - Clicking
      the numbers or letters in their correct numerical or alphabetical order will

    Description: 'Playskool Puzzles is a set of five educational puzzles intended
      for kids aged 3 to 6:


      Explore It! - The player chooses between four pictures (Park, House, Beach and
      Farm). Each location will have different elements and objects removed and placed
      randomly at the bottom of the screen. The main objective is to reassemble the
      picture by sticking the objects in their corresponding areas. Once the image
      is back to its original form, the player can click on some of its elements to
      explore them. For example, after completing the park, clicking on the circus
      within it will trigger a new such puzzle. Clicking on a particular object in
      the final exploration puzzle will reveal a separate animation featuring it and
      its name. This way, the kids can learn new words and associate them.


      Puzzle Maker - A puzzle editor. Using the toolbox and a selection of premade
      objects, the user can create new puzzles or modify existing ones. Puzzle Maker
      will automatically import the last picture seen while playing any of the other
      puzzles. The picture can be cut in three different ways and after that you need
      to reassemble it as it''s normally done in Jigsaw.


      Connect the Dots - Clicking the numbers or letters in their correct numerical
      or alphabetical order will trace the margin of an object. After connecting all
      the dots correctly, the game will show the full object, its name and an animation
      for it.


      Mix and Match - It involves combining different body parts to obtain a funny-looking
      character.


      Jigsaw - An ordinary jigsaw puzzle.


      In every puzzle it''s possible to modify the original image''s colors and draw
      other stuff on it using the toolbox. The result can usually be saved or printed.
      There are three difficulty settings: Easy, Medium and Hard.'

      interactive murder mystery based on Raymond Chandler''s legendary detective.

      This game is a fully interactive, richly designed CD-ROM in the film noir tradition.

      Meet starlets, confront a manic mobster, search Hollywood for clues you can
      take. Hundreds of interactive decisions are yours!

      It all starts with an innocent girl who hires you to find her missing brother,
      but it soon leads to a trail of greed, blackmail, revenge, deceit and murder!

      Find out who is guilty, before the bad guys or the cops get you. If you don''t
      solve the crime, no one will!'

      Phillip Marlowe, who is trying to do what he does best i.e., solve a murder
      mystery. The game features alternate endings, voice acting, lots of cut-scenes
      and music faithful to the 1940's era, which the game is trying to represent.

      out which fruits are used and which locations they''ve been placed in. "Lines
      & Boxes"  is another logic game, making boxes by drawing lines between a grid
      of dots.Finally, Tangrams is a spatial recognition game, fitting pieces into
      different shapes. Most of these games have multiple difficulty levels. Although
      designed for children 3-8, many of the games should give even parents the occasional
      run-for-the-money at the Hardest level.Finally, there are four games just for
      fun: In "Circus Stormin''" - a side-scrolling arcade game - you control Putt-Putt
      up and down, moving him around obstacles and having him pick up balloons. There''s
      also a sliding tiles (logic puzzle) game with slightly varying images, and a
      Pachinko pinball where you can create your own ''field'' of 6x11 bumpers and
      the balls make amusing sounds when they hit. There''s also a 35-page in-game
      coloring coloring book with 16 mixable palette slots.'

    Description: The game starts with Putt-Putt (the purple car) and Pep (his brown
      puppy) driving on to the screen with a bunch of balloons in peps mouth. Putt-putt
      tells his companion to hold on to the balloons tightly, which Pep immediately
      lets go of by barking.In the rest of the game, the player progresses through
      different levels popping the balloons which seem to have multiplied hundreds
      of times. Using the mouse, move Putt-putt across the screen, bouncing Pep on
      the seats or dashboard. Different balloons are introduced during the game including
      candy balloons which gives the player 50 points for each piece of candy caught,
      paint-bucket balloons which change the player's color depending on the balloon,
      and question mark balloons which gives the player a power-up such as Fireman
      Pep. The game also has a level builder.

    Description: 'The game is set in China in 2010. You''re part of an international
      group to excavate the tomb of Qin Shi Huangdi, the greatest secret of the ancient
      world. Somehow, you get trapped inside the tomb. The game takes place in the
      year 2010, where the international conglomerate "Mega Media," headed by Hal
      Davis, funds a government-approved excavation of the Qin burial mound. The player
      takes on the role of a researcher assigned to this project. (In reality, the
      chamber of the terracotta army is the farthest any archaeological team has progressed.)
      One night, as the researcher is exploring alone, a sudden earthquake opens up
      the ground underneath, and the researcher tumbles into a deeper part of the
      tomb. While exploring the tomb, which is immense, he is privy to the observations
      of the ghost of a Chinese scholar, who was aware of the brutal nature of the
      emperor and a witness to this brutality.


      The game eventually leads to a goal the emperor sought in life—an elixir that
      can confer immortality. Possessing this, the player has a choice: give it to
      the dead-but-not-quite-gone Qin, who will revive; deliver it to Hal Davis; or
      pour it into a scale model of the planet. Each has its own result—the renewed
      emperor will re-take control of China, Hal Davis becomes immortal in a decaying
      world, or kick-start the renewal of the planet itself, respectively.'

      of the progressive-rock band Queensrÿche.


      The premise of the game is all about the symbol or totem of the band (called
      the "Tri-rÿche"), which is composed of five parts, and at the beginning of the
      game it scatters every piece in a different "world", and each of these worlds
      happen to be created by each of the band member''s dreams and worries.


      So your job is to find each of the pieces and rebuild the totem, and to accomplish
      this you''ll have to solve puzzles and minigames. As you find each piece, the
      band member who "owns" that world lets you have a glimpse of his work in the
      band in the form of musical videos.


      The game is a 2-CD set, the game fills up the first one, and in the second you''ll
      find mini-documentaries and music videos.'

      visited in any order at all and returned to at any time. The bus is divided
      between front and back - in the back the player will find experiments to perform
      on rock samples, as well as a dress-up activity and a kitchen where he can investigate
      the effects of heat, gas, and pressure on the samples.At each of the sites,

    Description: Made by Maxis, the company famous for its line of "Sim" games, SimPark
      deals with the simulation and management of a real wildlife park.  SimPark allows
      you to build and manage parks from scratch, completely isolated from civilization.  You
      have the choice of choosing from hundreds of different species of flowers, bushes,
      plants, mammals, birds, and reptiles to live and thrive in your park.  Which
      plants and animals to put in is completely your choice, but you have to make
      sure that their biological needs are met so that they won't die.  You start
      out with a bare patch of land, but as you add plants and animals, it will begin
      to grow.  Depending on the climate and food available, certain animals will
      even begin migrating to your park.  SimPark contains a massive database of plants
      and animals that you need to use in order for your park to flourish.  Over hundreds
      of species are cataloged in SimPark, and each article includes a brief bio,
      their scientific name, their wants and needs, and even an authentic recording
      of what each animal sounds like.  You need to utilize this information to figure
      out what plants and animals to put in your park, in order for the creatures
      to flourish.  If a creature or plant does not get enough food, a plant does
      not like the climate, or trees do not get the amount of water they need, your
      park will not grow.When plants and animals are placed incorrectly, the park
      becomes unstable.  Weeds and animals will begin to overpopulate the park.  Other
      trees will die or get overeaten by rampaging species.  Because of this, the
      game tries to teach the concept of a "balanced ecosystem."  It is up to you
      to have an understanding of the animals in your park to preserve a balance.  Only
      through a perfectly balanced biological system can all of the creatures flourish.Besides
      the biological aspect, there is also the managerial aspect of it.  Above all,
      it is up to you to manage the budget for the park.  Planting trees and adapting
      animals costs money, and if you can't manage that money, you're fired.  Even
      though you get federal funding each year, it is also important to attract visitors
      to the park to make a little income.  You need to make provisions for humans,
      like paths and bathrooms.  You also have to make sure visitors behave and do
      not litter or ravage the park.  Besides this, you also have the duty to identify
      species in your park, through a mini-game which has you identify them through
      their characteristics.  As well, you may  have to decide on other things like
      if you want to receive donations, or cater to boyscout parties (which might
      have negative affects on the ecosystem).Like any classic Sim game, you can ravage
      your own park with disasters.  You can simulate a garbage dump disaster (a large
      pile of garbage and lots of rats), a fire, an alien invasion (pink and blue
      blobs that create garbage) and a kudzu infestation.

      can simulate a garbage dump disaster (a large pile of garbage and lots of rats),
      a fire, an alien invasion (pink and blue blobs that create garbage) and a kudzu
      infestation.'

    Description: SimTown is one of several entries in the city-building simulation
      series, SimCity. As in prior installments, players are tasked as the mayor of
      a newly formed municipality, taking charge of it's expansion and success. Being
      aimed at a younger audience than that of the other games within the series a
      greater emphasis is placed on managing a small, socially ideal town than a sprawling
      metropolis. As such it features a much more stylized, cartoon representation
      and user interface, a number of added features allowing for greater interactivity
      with the populace, and a simplified system of resource management.As their first
      priority as mayor players will simply need to construct a town, supplying not
      only housing for their residents but employment, schools, and civic buildings
      as well; Roadways and bike paths being needed to connect them all. While each
      building has its own associated costs and benefits they're often marginal enough
      that a player's selection will often be as much an aesthetic consideration as
      a functional one. In order to finance all of this consideration will also have
      to be paid to the player's limited resources of water, wood, and crops, which
      rejuvenate only so quickly.Interacting with the populace will also be crucial
      to success. Individual citizens will often offer suggestions and make demands
      of the mayor and so a close eye will have to be kept on their opinions of how
      the city is being run. Those that favor specific types of restaurants will request
      them and objections will be made if the city is lacking in their preferred form
      of recreation. Players can also take a closer look at their residents by 'removing'
      the tops of buildings and peering inside, watching their life unfold on a more
      minute scale. Specially constructed designer characters can also be made to
      populate the town, built to pre-defined specifications such as their preferred
      clothing and personal preferences.A number of awards can be gained within the
      game for exemplary achievements resulting from maintaining a balanced town for
      some period of time. An in-game newspaper will assist in these efforts by helping
      to keep the player up to date on what might be wrong in their city, or how they
      might be succeeding.

    Description: 'Solitaire Twin Pack contains two card games, Pyramid Solitaire and
      Golf Solitaire.Pyramid Solitaire : In this game the cards are arranged in a
      pyramid and the object is to remove cards totalling 13 until all cards have
      been removed. In this game each card has a value starting with the Ace which
      counts as 1 through to the King which counts as 13. The object is to make 13
      points i order to remove cards from play so at 13 points Kings can be removed
      as soon as they become available but Aces must be paired with Queens, 2''s with
      Jacks, e.t.c. Each card removed will make available the card above it in the
      pyramid. When a player runs out of moves to make they may draw another card
      from the deck and try to use that card to form a match. The game concludes when
      all the cards have been removed from the pyramid or when no more moves are possible.Golf
      Solitaire : This may be played as a single hand or as a series of nine hands
      or holes in the game terminology.  The player starts each ''hole'' with a score
      of 35 points, that''s the number of cards that are on the table. One point is
      deducted for each card removed from the table. The object in each ''hole'' is
      to clear all the cards from the table. The object of each game, as in a round
      of golf, is to finish with as low a score as possible. Card suits are irrelevant
      in this game. The player removes cards from the table by putting together sequences
      of cards starting with the card turned over. A sequence is made by playing a
      card from the table that is numerically one different from the card that''s
      in play. Thus if a 5 were turned over the player could play any available 6
      or any available 4 because these numbers are next in sequence. Once the 6 or
      4 is played the turn continues until there are no more cards to be added to
      the sequence at which point the next card is turned over.    Both games are
      played with the mouse and come with in-game help text, and the ability to change
      the pattern on the back of the cards. Only Pyramid Solitaire has an Undo function
      and only Golf Solitaire has a Save Game option.'

      In the math rooms there are numerous numerals dancing around and the player

      The reading room contains balloons with pictures that has to be matched with
      the words written on the chalkboards. In each room the player has to avoid Dr.
      Robotnik who steals the answers when he gets close.


      In addition to the classroom lessons there are two recess mini games that can
      be accessed in the backyard. These are made available by collecting recess power
      ups in the classrooms. The first one is a 3D version of concentration where
      the player uncovers question marks to reveal objects and the aim is to make
      matches of two of the same kind. The second is called ring hunt and simply involve
      collecting a certain number of rings without getting caught by any of Dr. Robotnik''s
      henchmen. It is also possible to make field trips on a school bus. Aboard the

      On the main page, Stanley the sea otter introduces the player to the game, which
      allows a child to create his own animated story using stickers, music and special
      sound effects on a chosen background.


      The player can view a sample story to get an idea of how his finished story
      might look; when he selects See How to Make a Story, Stanley will take him through
      all the steps. Once the player chooses Make a New Story, he is taken to the
      neighborhood map, where he can select from fifteen different backgrounds to
      use in his story, including a plain white background for those who want to include
      a lot of text.'

      From the story page the player can choose from a large number of stickers featuring
      characters familiar from other Edmark games such as Bailey''s Book House and
      Millie''s Math House, and more, as well as other character and object stickers
      which can be resized and animated. Here, the player can also add music and sound
      effects or record his own sounds to attach to the stickers on his page. Text
      is added from here as well; the player can select from four fonts, choose a
      text color and decide how it should line up. If the player needs help thinking
      of a story idea he can click on Stanley, who will show an idea for a story that
      uses numbers, or one that uses letters and words. As in all the Edmark Early
      Learning games, adult options are accessed by pressing Ctrl/Alt + A in Windows,
      Option/Command + A on a Macintosh.


      When the story is finished it can be saved and played back in See-A-Story mode
      and printed from the main story page.'

    Description: Welcome to the Klingon Language Immersion holodeck program. You will
      be guided by Gowron (his hologram, actually) in this true immersive experience
      in the Klingon culture. You will participate as Pok, a young Klingon about to
      take his Rite of Ascension. You start at home getting ready to entertain guests
      of your father. Be ready to participate in this interactive adventure, so you
      can truly experience what it feels to be a Klingon. Klingon is basically a full-motion
      video click-your-own-adventure. At certain points in the game, you will be given
      a few seconds to make a decision on what to do. You perform action by clicking
      on the object onscreen, or do nothing (which is sometimes appropriate). Make
      the right choice, and the game continues. Make the wrong choice, and Gowron
      scolds you for not learning, and gives you another chance as the program was
      "rewound" back to that decision point. The game also comes packaged with a Klingon
      Language Lab, which helps to teach you about the Klingon language, complete
      with speech recognition to correct your Klingon pronunciation.

    Description: The Master of Mischief is planning on making Shady Glen School disappear!
      He has invented disappearing paint, and turned five paint brushes into robots
      to paint the school at midnight. The Master of Mischief himself is disguised
      as a robot, and it is your job to find him. Hidden throughout the school are
      clues which reveal his whereabouts. Robots are placed in the school to slow
      your progress, some of which may even contain clues themselves. You carry a
      camera with you to take a picture and examine dangerous robots closer.

    Description: This is an interactive movie game based on the 1996 live action movie
      by the same name. After Pinocchio realizes his dream of becoming a real boy,
      the evil Lorenzini kidnaps him and turns him back into a puppet. You must help
      Pinocchio's creator, Geppetto, find and rescue him.  You'll go through Pinocchio's
      home town, row a boat through monster-infested waters and visit Terra Magica,
      the fair where Lorenzini turns boys into donkeys. To succeed, you'll have to
      dodge deadly traps, solve puzzles and outwit Lorenzini's conniving henchmen.
      Sometimes, you'll have to turn yourself into a puppet, a fish, a bird or even
      a donkey to rescue Pinocchio.  Along the way you must collect six passwords,
      each reflecting a lesson in morality that Pinocchio learns. You are aided by
      live-action guides Lumina and Candlewick who will offer different suggestions
      as to what to do but you must decide.  There are plenty of wide-screen scenes
      from the movie and a ton of original footage. The game comes on 4 CDs ("The
      Village", "The Forest", "The Sea", and "Terra Magica") because of the FMV (though
      the video takes up only half the screen), each disk representing another world
      to explore.  You must make plot choices and solve puzzles through clicking on
      the interface around the FMV or on the FMV itself. It allows for microphone
      input also through voice recognition technology that allows the user to control
      the events on the screen through voice alone.

    Description: 'The Adventures of Valdo & Marie is an educational game for kids.
      The player takes the role of Valdo who is aboard a 16th century Portuguese ship
      heading for Japan. On the journey, they will explore exotic lands and deal with
      pirates, sharks, and storms. The main objective of the game is to gather the
      scattered pieces of a treasure map and reveal a mysterious adventure. Most of
      the gameplay consists of the usual adventure activities: searching the environment,
      collecting items and solving puzzles. Most of them are of the classic item based
      kind but there are also a few dialogue and logic puzzles. Additionally the player
      has to solve a few action based mini games, e.g. a Soko-Ban or a Lemmings variant.
      It is possible to bypass some puzzles entirely which has a impact later in the
      game: either getting stuck without the possibility of going back or receiving
      another of the nine endings.The educational part of the game consists mostly
      of the historically accurate foundation of the story and the environment. There
      are also many additional information in text form to read. Some puzzles require
      this knowledge to be solved, e.g. about ship speed.'

    Description: 'The Adventures of Valdo & Marie is an educational game for kids.
      The player takes the role of Valdo who is aboard a 16th century Portuguese ship
      heading for Japan. On the journey, they will explore exotic lands and deal with
      pirates, sharks, and storms. The main objective of the game is to gather the
      scattered pieces of a treasure map and reveal a mysterious adventure.


      Most of the gameplay consists of the usual adventure activities: searching the
      environment, collecting items and solving puzzles. Most of them are of the classic
      item based kind but there are also a few dialogue and logic puzzles. Additionally
      the player has to solve a few action based mini games, e.g. a Soko-Ban or a
      Lemmings variant. It is possible to bypass some puzzles entirely which has a
      impact later in the game: either getting stuck without the possibility of going
      back or receiving another of the nine endings.


      The educational part of the game consists mostly of the historically accurate
      foundation of the story and the environment. There are also many additional
      information in text form to read. Some puzzles require this knowledge to be
      solved, e.g. about ship speed.'

      compare, and combine attributes; how to use parts to create a whole; how to
      complete patterns; how to recognize changes and attributes that create patterns;
      and how to hypothesize and test a rule.


      In Toony Loon students improvise their own musical patterns and tunes on unique
      xylophones.


      In the final activity, Fripple Shop, students are shown a variety of Fripples
      each with different attributes. Customers order fripples with specific attributes
      and the student must find them. Students may receive Fripple orders from customers
      by: clicking on the door (auditory and visual); clicking on a fax (visual only);
      or clicking the phone (auditory only). This Activity allows teachers and parents
      to observe how individual students learn.'

    Description: Torin is a young boy who lives in a little country house on a planet
      called Strata with his parents and with his purple cat-like friend Boogle. One
      day he returns home, only to find out his parents were imprisoned in a magical
      spell. Apparently, the spell was cast by a sorceress named Lycentia. He must
      now travel to distant lands to find a way to remove the spell and confront the
      sorceress. What he doesn't know is that this journey will also help him to discover
      his true origins and his true purpose in life...Created by Al Lowe of Leisure
      Suit Larry fame, Torin's Passage is a fairy tale-like humorous adventure with
      cartoon-style graphics and animations. Torin interacts with characters and objects
      in a point-and-click fashion, and can also use Boogle's special shape-shifting
      abilities. During their journey, Boogle will learn how to turn into a variety
      of objects, which is essential for solving many of the game's puzzles. The game
      also has many traditional inventory-based tasks as well as other types of puzzles.
      To facilitate the puzzle-solving, the game has a built-in hint system; using
      the hints will deduce points from the player's score.

      now travel to distant lands to find a way to remove the spell and confront the
      sorceress. What he doesn''t know is that this journey will also help him to
      discover his true origins and his true purpose in life...


      Created by Al Lowe of Leisure Suit Larry fame, Torin''s Passage is a fairy tale-like
      humorous adventure with cartoon-style graphics and animations. Torin interacts
      with characters and objects in a point-and-click fashion, and can also use Boogle''s
      special shape-shifting abilities. During their journey, Boogle will learn how
      to turn into a variety of objects, which is essential for solving many of the
      game''s puzzles. The game also has many traditional inventory-based tasks as
      well as other types of puzzles. To facilitate the puzzle-solving, the game has
      a built-in hint system; using the hints will deduce points from the player''s
      score.'

    Description: An activist surfer is found dead on the beach. It is up to the player
      to collect evidence and solve the crime.The third installment of the Virtual
      Murder series (now renamed Murder Mystery) follows the same overall design of
      the other games. The player has six hours to solve the murder, and time diminishes
      with each action executed (interviewing suspects, examining items on the crime
      scene), with the exception of a brief case summation that can be played without
      any time decrease.After gathering enough evidence (stored automatically in the
      notebook area), the player can call a press conference and answer questions
      about the case. If this questionnaire is filled correctly, the game moves to
      its second level, where the player must present the case to the judge.On the
      previous iterations, the murderer was selected randomly by the computer out
      of three possible choices. This time, the player can select directly one of
      the three game paths at the beginning of the game. Each has small alterations
      and different clues, although the setting remains the same.

      Crusaders of the Dark Savant is the seventh installment of the Wizardry series
      and a direct sequel to Bane of the Cosmic Forge. In the end of the previous
      game, the party of heroes finally acquired the Cosmic Forge. However, before
      they were able to decide what to do with it, it was taken away by a servant
      of the Cosmic Lords, the cyborg Aletheides. It appears that the Cosmic Forge
      was in fact a clue to the location of the Astral Dominae, the artifact of life,
      somewhere on the planet Guardia, which has now been revealed to the universe.


      The heroes then travel to Guardia, which is populated by many races and organizations
      with their own agendas, including the rhinoceros-like Imperial Umpani Federation
      and the spidery T''Rang affiliated with a malevolent being known as the Dark
      Savant, whose goal is to get rid of the Cosmic Lords. All these factions are
      looking for the Astral Dominae, finding which is the primary goal of the game.
      Depending on the decisions made by the player in the previous game (should he
      opt to import the party from there), the game will have different openings and
      begin in different locations. However, regardless of the initial premise, the
      player is free to follow or betray whatever faction he was supposed to be allied
      with.


      The gameplay system is very similar to that of its predecessor, retaining the
      races, the classes, the skills and the magic system it introduced to the series.
      The trademark first-person exploration and turn-based combat are present as
      well. Unlike the previous games, Crusaders of the Dark Savant allows the player
      to explore towns and vast forest areas between them, in addition to several
      large dungeons situated in different areas of the game world. Many NPCs have
      their own agendas and may move between locations as well, and even obtain crucial
      items themselves if the player-controlled party is not quick enough, forcing
      the player to change plans. The exotic setting contains elements of science
      fiction on top of the traditional fantasy background. Like in the previous game,
      encounters, events, as well as the heroes'' reflections upon them are described
      through text messages.


      A few skills have been added, including swimming and climbing, as well as diplomacy.
      The latter reflects the more important role dialogues and interaction with NPCs
      play in the game compared to the previous installments of the series. A mapping
      skill has been added, which, if learned, displays - for the first time in the
      computer releases of Wizardry games - an automap on top of the exploration screen.
      Skills are increased with repeated usage and the characters now receive separate
      bonus points for each category (weapon, physical, and academia). Like before,
      magic is divided into four schools (Psionics, Alchemy, Theology, and Thaumaturgy)
      and six elemental categories.'

    Description: 'World Empire IV is a strategy game that uses maps of real countries.
      Players start with either 56 or 30 armies. There are three game modes: local
      (includes TCP/IP Network); Cyberwar (Internet); or War on Terror. Multiple combinations
      of human and computer players are possible. Network game hosting requires the
      World Empire game server be installed on the network.


      All games (except the Real World Simulation) start with all countries neutral
      or all conquered. In all modes, players can chose which countries to start in,
      or be randomly assigned. Each player adopts an ideology that determines if a
      country to be entered is friendly or unfriendly. Individual battle and attack
      outcomes are computer determined, based on a combination of ideology and random
      factors. Conquered ''unfriendlies'' require more occupation armies to prevent
      a revolution from taking place.


      War on Terror mode is only for local play. One human player opposes Osama Smith
      and the Axis of Evil (Saddam Jones, Kim Doe-il, and Shah Sayed) with a variety
      of player combinations. Computer players are illustrated with photos.


      In Cyberwar mode, a chat window allows players to communicate before and during
      games. The Game host determines the number of players, country status, and whether
      to allow revolutions or air/sea invasions, or surrenders. Once a game has started,
      exiting human players can be replaced with computer players.


      The object of local and Internet play to to take over all world countries by
      defeating opponents country by country. The object of the War of Terror mode
      is to root out all terrorist cells and secure the world.'

    Description: You Don't Know Jack is a humorous trivia game for up to three players.
      The players take part in a quiz game, which partly parodies television shows
      such as Jeopardy. The players do need to answer serious questions, and knowledge
      of various topics (ranging from classical literature to modern pop culture)
      is required; however, the show's host is distinguished by his sense of sarcasm,
      sometimes offering humorous wordings for questions, and sardonically addressing
      the participants.

      Like its predecessor, the game imitates a television game show. Each game can

      a "buzzer," each player tries to be the first to answer a trivia question that
      pops on the screen. Many questions are humorously structured, drawing inspiration
      from pop culture references. The game''s "host" provides jocular commentary
      during the show.The sequel adds new gameplay modes: DisOrDat, in which players
      have to quickly classify words into two or more categories; Celebrity Collect
      Calls, which features real-life characters asking bizarre questions; and Picture
      Questions, which adds pictures to the predominantly sound-oriented game.'
